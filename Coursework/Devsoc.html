                <p> DevSoc is the Developer's Society here at NTU. It is one of the main societies under the Department of Computer Science and focuses on all things to do with Computer Science and IT The community primarily communicates through Discord which
                    is where you'll recieve announcements for the various events and workshops hosted by DevSoc. They host a variety of events such as HackTheBox and Capture the Flag style hacking challenges, IBM's Master the Mainframe comptetion and
                    HackNotts, as well as game nights and the afformentioned workshops in which the commitee members lead classes on areas such as Python and Web Devlopment. The current members of the DevSoc Commitee are:

                <h1> DevSoc Cryptography Challenge </h1>
                <p> The DevSoc Cryptography Challenge was a fortnight-long event in which we had to follow a variety of clues to obtain three flags (in this case key-words). We had to decode a variety of ciphers as well as follow different hints layed out
                    across various social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Github and YouTube. Once we had obtained the three keys we had to combine them and then submit that final key to a form, after which DevSoc confirmed whether or not
                    it was correct and informed us either way. This challenge took me around 10 hours to complete and so, I claimed 10 hours of DevSoc CPD. The images below are some examples of the kind of thing that was involved in the Cryptography 
                    Challenge. On the left is an example of one of the three encrypted keys, in the middle is an encryption key that was needed to decrypt a hint an on the right is the logo for the challenge.
